# WireSpy
WireSpy is a command-line tool designed to analyze network traffic and perform network scans and mappings using packets captured by TShark.
It performs:
- [x] Port scan
- [ ] Network mapping (will be added)
- [ ] OS fingerprint (will be added)

<br>

## Dependencies
This code relies on two dependencies: TShark and the PyShark Python library. TShark is responsible for capturing and dissecting packets, while PyShark serves as a Python interface for TShark, simplifying the process of analyzing network packets programmatically.
